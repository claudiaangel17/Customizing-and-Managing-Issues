## Step 2: Create custom filters and views

Custom filters allow you to save frequent searches for easy access later. Let's create a set of useful filters.

### 🔍 Creating saved searches

Saved searches appear in your issues sidebar for quick access:

1. After performing a search, look for the **Save search** option
2. Name your search something descriptive
3. Access saved searches from the sidebar on the Issues page

### :keyboard: Task: Create multiple custom filters

Create the following saved searches:

1. `is:open is:issue sort:updated-desc` - Recently updated issues
2. `is:open is:issue assignee:@me milestone:current` - Your tasks for the current milestone
3. `is:open is:issue label:help-wanted` - Open issues seeking help
4. Comment "filters-created" when you've created all three saved searches
